# QuantumAssembly
This is my implementation of a Quantum Assembly Interpreter.

Theory is based on: 
-Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists by N. Yanofsky and M Mannucci
-Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing by T. Wong

The syntax is based on:
-Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists by N. Yanofsky and M Mannucci

A more detailed account of the syntax and semantics will be provided later.
